# Pomodoro Timer ‚è≥üçÖ

This is a simple desktop Pomodoro Timer app built using Python and the Tkinter library.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you focus and work with the time you have. It breaks work into 25-minute sessions (called "Pomodoros"), separated by short breaks. After a few sessions, you take a longer break.

In this version, for testing and demonstration purposes, the times are set to **1 minute** for work and short breaks. The long break is **20 minutes**.

## Features

- Start a work timer  
- Take short and long breaks automatically  
- Reset the timer anytime  
- Checkmarks are displayed for completed work sessions

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer.  
2. Save the files in a folder:
   - `main.py` (the code file)  
   - `tomato.png` (an image file used in the interface)  
3. Open the terminal or command prompt.  
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. A simple window will appear. Click **Start** to begin your work session.  
6. After each work session, a short or long break will follow automatically.
